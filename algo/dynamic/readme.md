## Dynamic

Problems and solutions associated with recursive calls.

1. `gridTraveler.js`

   A traveler begins in the top-left corner of a m x n grid and ends in the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right. Calculate how many routes you can travel to the goal.

2. `canSum.js`

   Given a target number and an array of numbers. Write algorithm to indicate if it is possible to generate the target sum using the numbers from the array. You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

3. `howSum.js`

   Follow up the previous problem: return an array containing one combination of the numbers that add up to exactly the target number.

4. `bestSum.js`

   Follow up the prvious problem: return an array that has the shortest combination of the numbers.

5. `canConstruct.js`

   Given a target string and an array of strings. Write algorithm to indicate if it is possible to construct the target string by concatenating elements of the strings array.

6. `countConstruct.js`

   Follow up the previous problem: return the number of ways to construct the target string by concatenating elements of the strings array.

7. `allConstruct.js`

   Follow up the previous problem: return all the ways to construct the target string by concatenating elements of the strings array.

8. `commonChild.js`

   Find out the longest common 'child' string of two given strings.
