## Data Structure

### What is data structure

Ways of organizing information with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing records<br>
JS natively implements severl data structures. But you still need to be familiar with 'inferior' data structure

### Types of data structure

- Queues: First-in-first-out data collection.
- Stack: First-in-last-out data collection.
- Linked List: An ordered collection of data, which contains some amount of nodes. Each node contains some data and a reference to the next node. It has two special nodes, which are head node and tail node.
- Tree: A collection of data with multiple levels or hierachies. The node structor in a tree is similar to the node in linked list but tree also has some special nodes: parent node, child node, sibling node, root node etc. A common operation of tree is iteration. Unlike other types of data structure whose data has an order, tree doesn't. So it can have two ways of iteration: Breadth-First algorithm(广度优先) and Depth-First algorithm(深度优先)
- Binary Tree: A tree, with every node having two or zero children. The two children nodes are called left node and right node.
- Binary Search Tree: A binary tree and every node's value is greater than its left value and less than its right value.
