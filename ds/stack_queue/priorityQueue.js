/**
 * @name priorityQueue
 * @description Implement a priority queue.
 * A Priority Queue is a special type of Queue in which items may have additional information which specifies their priority.
 * This could be simply represented with an integer.
 * Item priority will override placement order in determining the sequence items are dequeued.
 * If an item with a higher priority is enqueued after items with lower priority, the higher priority item will be dequeued before all the others.
 * For instance, letâ€™s imagine we have a priority queue with three items:
 * [['kitten', 2], ['dog', 2], ['rabbit', 2]]
 * Here the second value (an integer) represents item priority. If we enqueue ['human', 1] with a priority of 1
 * (assuming lower priorities are given precedence) it would then be the first item to be dequeued.
 * The collection would look like this:
 * [['human', 1], ['kitten', 2], ['dog', 2], ['rabbit', 2]]
 * Implement a priority queue with the methods of:
 * 1. enqueue: adding an item with a priority.
 * 2. dequeue: remove and return an item.
 * 3. peek: return the element at the front of the queue.
 * 4. size: return the size of the queue.
