# JS Algorithms problems and solutions

## Intro
Algorithms questions and solutions written in Javascript, including test cases.

## Content
* Reverse a string - reversestring.js
* Test a string is a palindrome(its reversed string is exactly the same as itself) - palindrome.js
* Reverse an integer - reverseint.js
* Get the character that most commonly appears in a given string - maxchar.js
* fizzbuzz, print the numbers from 1 to N.
 But for multiples of 3 print 'fizz' instead of the number;
 for multiples of 5, print 'buzz';
 for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'fizzbuzz' - fizzbuzz.js

 ## How to run
 ### In the 'js-algo' directory:
 * Run `npm install` to install packages required.
 * Run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` to run the test cases. You can write your own testing code to see the results.
